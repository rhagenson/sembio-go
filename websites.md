# Websites

Here is a collection of websites where biological information standards have been defined.

## GSC -- Genomics Standards Consortium

### Overview

Has a number of ongoing projects that define standards for analyzing genomic information.

Projects listing: http://gensc.org/projects/

### Purpose

Defines the minimum information about any sequence (MIxS Project) and purpose/structure of metadata (M5 Project). Most GSC projects have been around for a long while which affords them a certain level of robustness and orthogonality.


## SMBL -- Systems Biology Markup Language

Defines a machine-readable systems biology language for representing biological models in a one-size-fits-none manner due to the diversity of such models. The SMBL is defined in semantics across XML representation.

Webpage: http://sbml.org/

### Purpose

Systems biology and general biological model representation should test the limits of my ability to encode an interface as I wish to do with BiGr. A `bigr.SMBL` interface should push the limits and uncover many patterns for resolving conflicts between static interfacing and dynamic biological models.
