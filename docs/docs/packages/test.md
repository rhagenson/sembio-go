## Test

The package all tests should refer to in some way (also the reason tests are put in separate packages to what they test).
This package contains generalized testing constants (such as the seed used to randomize inputs in property tests) and reflective bootstrapping functions (such as those to look for methods that return the same type as their receiver type).
