## Utilities

Simply a collection of useful utilities.
Often these are functions that do a task that might be required, but simply to program such as reversing a string by each byte (`ReverseByBytes(s string) string`) or converting a byte array to a string array (`BytesToStrings(bs []byte) []string`).
Any generally useful "simple" task that could be said to "glue" parts of a solution together is a good candidate for inclusion here.
