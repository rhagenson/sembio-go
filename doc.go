Package bio is a library representing Bioinformatics solutions.

This library defines biological data types abstractly by their functionality (interfaces) and
how these abstract types relate to one another (functions) while not requiring any set structure.
The advantage of this approach is that concrete data can be
restructured for efficiency while still providing a compile-time check that it is still
a functional representation of its abstract type.
